<div class='page'><strong><h1>Automotive Door Control System Design </h1></strong><br /><br /><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Disclaimer : This project is part of &quot;Advanced Embedded Systems&quot; Nanodegree attended at Udacity and FWD program.</span></em><br /><br /><h2>Project Mission:</h2>⇒ In the automotive industry, ECUs are communicating together to provide safety and driver&#39;s comfort, ECUs are microcontrollers connected with input and output devices, input devices to sense the surrounding environments, and output devices to perform actions according to readings that came from input devices.<br />⇒ The project aims to build two ECUs communicating together to control car lights according to door state, light switch state, and car speed state.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Project Components:</h2><h3>1) System Schematic for Mentioned System Requirements:</h3><strong>⇒ Hardware System Requirements</strong><br />	• Two microcontrollers connected via CAN bus<br />	• One Door sensor (D)<br />	• One Light switch (L)<br />	• One Speed sensor (S)<br />	• ECU 1 connected to D, S, and L, all input devices<br />	• Two lights, right (RL) and left (LL)<br />	• One buzzer (B)<br />	• ECU 2 connected to RL, LL, and B, all output devices<br /><br /><strong>⇒ Software Requirements:</strong><br />	• ECU 1 will send status messages periodically to ECU 2 through the CAN protocol<br />	• Status messages will be sent using Basic Communication Module (BCM)<br />	• Door state message will be sent every 10ms to ECU 2<br />	• Light switch state message will be sent every 20ms to ECU 2<br />	• Speed state message will be sent every 5ms to ECU 2<br />	• Each ECU will have an OS and application SW components<br />	• If the door is opened while the car is moving → Buzzer ON, Lights OFF<br />	• If the door is opened while the car is stopped → Buzzer OFF, Lights ON<br />	• If the door is closed while the lights were ON → Lights are OFF after 3 seconds<br />	• If the car is moving and the light switch is pressed → Buzzer OFF, Lights ON<br />	• If the car is stopped and the light switch is pressed → Buzzer ON, Lights ON<br /><br /><h3>2) Static Design Analysis:</h3><strong>⇒ For ECU1 &amp; ECU2 provided the:</strong><br />	• System layered architecture design<br />	• ECU components and modules<br />	• Full detailed APIs for each module<br />	• System project folder structure according to the previous points<br /><br /><h3>3) Dynamic design analysis:</h3><strong>⇒ For ECU1 &amp; ECU2 provided the:</strong><br />	• State machine diagram for the ECU component<br />	• State machine diagram for the ECU operation<br />	• Sequence diagram for the ECU<br />	• CPU load for the ECU calculated<br /><br /><strong>⇒ For the system  provide the:</strong><br />    • Bus load in the system calculated : With what percentage of system bus was busy per 1 second?<br />    <br /><br />_____________________________________________________________<br />(<em>Repo contains an illustrating videos for the system design in Arabic</em>)<br /></div>
